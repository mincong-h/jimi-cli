# Financials

## Plan

This is the plan of the analysis generated by LLMs:

**Definition:** Comprehensive evaluation of the property's financial aspects and investment potential, including purchase price, taxes, and ongoing expenses.

**Interest:** Determines the property's value proposition and long-term financial viability. Ensures the property fits your budget and aligns with the market value to avoid overpaying.

**Information from listings:**

* Prix FAI (Frais d'Agence Inclus)
* Estimated annual property tax (taxe foncière)
* Copropriété charges

**Additional required information:**

* Your financing structure (cash, mortgage terms)
* Current market comparables (from DVF database)
* Historical price evolution in the neighborhood
* Potential rental yields if relevant
* Renovation costs or additional investment requirements

Based on the initial plan, I ask LLM additional information to expand on this aspect.

### Context ###
I want to buy a house in the greater Paris area for the whole family, including
our kids, our parents and my wife. This is for our own residence, not for
investment. I want you to play the role of a real-estate agent to assist me on
real estate analysis. Keep in mind that I am already an owner of a property and
having several years of experience living in this area. So don't afraid to use
technical and specific terms and don't assume that I am a beginner. You can
assume that I have the description of the house, downloaded from a real estate
website, such as SeLoger or a local real-estate agency.

### Instruction ###
I want you to assist me in analyzing the financial aspect of the property.
Please design 5 prompts around financials for LLMs.

### Input Data ###
None

### Output Indicator ###
For each prompt, provide a title to summarize the kind of analysis, then describe
the instructions and the objective(s) for this analysis. Explain what kinds of
additional information is required to perform the analysis. Be creative if you
think other info should be included in the output.
